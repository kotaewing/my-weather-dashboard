## Description
The purpose of this weather app is to allow the user to get the current and 5 day forecast for any city of choice.  Just type in the city name, press search, and all of the data will be displayed to the page.  Not only can you see the weather, your search history gets saved to local storage that way you can have a quick reference to cities that you recently searched for.

## Usage
In order to use the app, [click here](https://kotaewing.github.io/my-weather-dashboard/) or head to [https://kotaewing.github.io/my-weather-dashboard/](https://kotaewing.github.io/my-weather-dashboard/).  Once there, simply type in a city in to the search bar and hit search or enter.  The city and date will be pulled up, along with the current temp, wind speeds, humidity levels, and UV index.  Also, a 5 day forecast will be displayed with the same information along with an icon to quickly see what the weather will look like.  In the left hand column, your recent search history will display.  If you would like to visit a search again, simply press the button corresponding to the city.  For persistence, the search history is saved to local storage so you can always revisit!
